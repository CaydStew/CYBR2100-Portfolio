1. ROE Outline (Final)
Purpose & Approvals

Purpose:
This Rules of Engagement (ROE) document defines the authorized scope, procedures, and roles for conducting ethical cybersecurity testing on selected systems. The primary objective is to protect organizational assets while minimizing disruption and risk.

Rationale:
Clearly defining ROE ensures compliance with legal and ethical standards, and helps reduce potential operational impacts during testing activities.

Approving Authorities:

Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

Legal Counsel

IT Operations Manager

Business Unit Owner(s)

Required Signatures:

Testing Coordinator (myself)

Approving Authority (CISO or designee)

Target Environment Owner

Scope & Authorization

In-Scope Systems:

Internal web applications (e.g., HR portal, Inventory Database)

Network infrastructure (e.g., 10.10.0.0/24 subnet)

Cloud-hosted services owned by the organization

Out-of-Scope Systems:

Third-party SaaS platforms

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data stores

Legacy systems labeled “Do Not Touch”

Authorization Statement:
Testing is explicitly authorized by [Company Name] and must remain within the defined scope. Any unauthorized activity beyond this scope is prohibited and may result in academic or legal consequences.

Timing & Deconfliction

Authorized Testing Period:

September 25–27, 2025

From 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM ET (low-impact hours)

Testing Restrictions:

No testing during patch cycles (e.g., Tuesdays from 10:00 AM–2:00 PM ET)

Blackout date: September 24 due to fiscal reporting

Deconfliction Measures:

I will coordinate with IT Operations through a shared calendar and provide at least 24 hours’ notice to stakeholders before beginning any test.

Communications & Escalation

Primary Contacts:

Myself (Testing Lead): [Your Name, phone, email]

Network Administrator: [Name, contact info]

Incident Response Contact: [Name, contact info]

Notification Requirements:

Pre-test notification: Minimum 24 hours in advance

Post-test summary: Delivered within 12 hours of completion

Escalation Protocols:

If system instability or business impact is observed, testing will stop immediately.

The keyword “STOPTEST” will be used via Slack or MS Teams to signal an emergency halt.

Data Handling

Collection Principles:
Only data required to validate test findings will be collected.

Storage Location:

Encrypted storage: \\secure\ROE_Test_Logs

Access is restricted to myself and any authorized audit personnel.

Retention and Deletion:

Logs will be retained for 30 days post-test.

All related files will be deleted after final reporting unless retention is required.

Redaction Policies:

PII and sensitive identifiers will be removed from screenshots and documentation.

Where possible, usernames and IP addresses will be anonymized.

Reporting & Handoff

Report Structure:

Executive Summary for non-technical stakeholders

Severity-ranked Technical Findings

Remediation Recommendations

Delivery Schedule:

Preliminary report: Delivered within 48 hours of testing

Final report: Submitted within 7 business days

Remediation Process:

Issues will be documented in JIRA and assigned to responsible teams

Fixes will be verified during a retest period

Final reports will be archived in a secure compliance repository

2. Consent/Authorization Snippet

I received formal approval to conduct cybersecurity testing activities limited to the systems and timeframe defined in this ROE. All actions are governed by ethical standards and legal requirements, and testing will be halted immediately if any system or user is negatively affected.

3. Escalation Contacts
Role	Name	Availability	Stop-Test Trigger
Testing Lead (Myself)	24/7 during test window	Scope breach, major vulnerability, or service issue
Network Administrator	8 AM–6 PM ET	Unusual traffic, instability, or system alert
Incident Response Lead	On-call	Indicators of compromise or data exposure

5. Reflection

One decision I would reconsider is the exclusion of legacy systems from the test scope. Although they were deemed unstable, such systems often carry significant risk and could be exploited by attackers. A limited, read-only assessment might have revealed important vulnerabilities without introducing disruption. In future assessments, I would aim for a more nuanced approach to legacy systems rather than omitting them entirely.
