My Ethical Lens (3–4 sentences): The ethical framework that 
best aligns with me is Humanism, as described by Martha 
Nussbaum. I value human dignity, autonomy, and well-being in 
both personal decisions and in how I engage with technology. 
I believe that technology should enhance human potential, 
not diminish it — supporting growth, education, and authentic 
human connection. This framework resonates with my goal to 
ensure all voices, especially the underserved, are considered 
in any decision-making process.

Authorization Principle (2–3 sentences): The Authorization Principle means that an action is ethical if it adheres to the accepted rules, policies, or authorities of the group or institution involved. For example, on campus, following the university's code of conduct regarding data privacy when using school-issued devices shows respect for institutional guidelines and the community's trust.

Policy Snippet (paste your final paragraph):Use of college lab systems and network resources is restricted to authorized students, faculty, and staff for instructional or approved research purposes only. Access is limited to assigned systems, software, and data within the course’s defined scope. Users must not engage in unauthorized scanning, penetration testing, traffic interception, or access to systems beyond their assigned privileges. Sharing credentials or attempting to bypass security controls, monitoring tools, or logging mechanisms is strictly prohibited. All activity may be logged, and users should assume minimal necessary monitoring for operational and security purposes. Personal or sensitive data should only be collected or processed if explicitly required and permitted. By using lab systems, users consent to responsible oversight for academic integrity and system security. Any suspected misuse, data exposure, or policy violation must be reported immediately to the course instructor or the college IT Security Office. Violations may result in suspension of access, academic penalties, or further disciplinary action under college policies.

Reflection (3–4 sentences): One area I would like to refine is balancing rule-following (authorization) with questioning outdated or unjust policies. While I respect structure, I realize ethical growth means sometimes challenging the status quo if it no longer serves human well-being. This matters because stakeholders like students, faculty, and marginalized groups can be harmed by blind compliance. In future decisions, I aim to be more intentional in evaluating both the human impact and the institutional expectations behind each ethical choice.
