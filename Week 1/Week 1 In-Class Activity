Use of college lab systems and network resources is restricted to authorized students, faculty, and staff for instructional or approved research purposes only. Access is limited 
to assigned systems, software, and data within the courseâ€™s defined scope. Users must not engage in unauthorized scanning, penetration testing, traffic interception, or access 
to systems beyond their assigned privileges. Sharing credentials or attempting to bypass security controls, monitoring tools, or logging mechanisms is strictly prohibited. 
All activity may be logged, and users should assume minimal necessary monitoring for operational and security purposes. Personal or sensitive data should only be collected or processed if explicitly required and permitted. By using lab systems, users consent to responsible oversight for academic integrity and system security. Any suspected misuse, data exposure, or policy violation must be reported immediately to the course instructor or the college IT Security Office. Violations may result in suspension of access, academic penalties, or further disciplinary action under college policies.
