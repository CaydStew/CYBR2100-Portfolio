What I Learned
This week, I focused on the Duty-Based Ethical Framework (Deontology) to guide my decisions in cybersecurity. Deontology, based on the ideas of Immanuel Kant, is all 
about following rules and doing what’s right, no matter the outcome. This approach fits well with the cybersecurity field, where following strict rules and standards is essential. 
Chapters 2–4 of the eBook talk about the CIA Triad—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—which also support the idea of following clear responsibilities. For example, refusing to access a system without proper permission is a good example of putting rules first.

The (ISC)² Code of Ethics also supports this way of thinking. It emphasizes acting honestly, legally, and in the public’s best interest. Both the ethical framework and the code highlight the importance of following rules and being responsible, even in tough or unclear situations. It’s not just about avoiding mistakes, but about doing what’s right 
because it’s your duty.

How I’ll Apply It: If I’m working in my university’s IT department and someone asks me to access a professor’s email to get files for a lecture, I wouldn’t do it without direct 
permission from the professor. Even if the person asking is another professor or administrator, I’d still need proper authorization. Acting based on trust or urgency isn’t 
enough. Using a duty-based approach, I would follow data access rules and put security and ethics ahead of convenience. This way, my actions are within the law and follow 
professional standards.

Muddiest Point: One thing I’m still unsure about is the difference between what’s ethical and what’s legal. For example, if someone finds a serious system flaw and fixes 
it without approval to avoid harm, that might be ethically right—but could it still be against the law?

My Question: How do we know when an action that seems ethically right becomes a legal problem, and how do companies make that line clear for their employees?

Portfolio Note: I’ll include this reflection in the ethics section of my portfolio to show how I’m developing my ethical thinking. I’ll also highlight the real-world example to show 
how I’m learning to apply these principles in practical situations.
