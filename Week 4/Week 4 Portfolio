My First-Hour Priorities

Preserve original message and headers: Email headers provide origin and routing information vital for verifying spoofing and identifying the delivery method.

Analyze attachment in an isolated environment: Prevents accidental execution of malicious payloads during triage.

Avoid blocking or takedown actions too early: Preserves the infrastructure for ongoing monitoring or intelligence gathering.

Document analyst decisions and approvals immediately: Maintains audit trail and proves proper authorization steps were followed.

Incident & Evidence Note (Final)

Timestamp & Context:
Alert received from Sam Rivera ([REDACTED]) on Thursday, Sep 11, 2025 at 13:15 UTC, regarding a suspicious email from donotreply@blackboard.com with an attached file titled Registration.pdf.html. The email claimed to offer registration for a professional development webinar.

Authorization:
Action authorized by Dr. Elena Marks, IT Security Officer, at 13:20 UTC via Teams. Approved for: evidence preservation, file analysis, phishing verification (no containment needed).

Actions Taken:

Extracted .eml file from mail server and analyzed full headers.

Scanned attachment using VirusTotal and Cuckoo sandbox.

Found HTML <form> POST to https://cdn-blackboard-mail.center/submit, an external and unauthorized domain.

Verified the domain is not affiliated with the real Blackboard platform.

Evidence Captured:

Email message (phish_email.eml)

HTML attachment (Registration.pdf.html)

SHA256 (attachment):
ea8b84b9fa514de47892c5bdeaa5eac8e0a420d3e89e2edbda3b347c3dd4e34c

Files stored at:
\\investigations\incident_20250911_srivera\

Chain of custody maintained (Analyst: [Your Name]; Supervisor: Elena Marks)

Redaction Policy:

Removed reporter’s email address from distributed artifacts.

Created a sanitized HTML version with <input> elements removed for instructional use.

Next Step Recommendations:

Block blackboard-mail.center at gateway.

Submit domain for takedown via PhishTank or host provider.

Alert staff of targeted phishing campaign.

Monitor for IP 192.0.2.66 in mail logs.

Integrity & Privacy Controls

All artifacts were hashed using SHA-256 and stored in a secured, access-controlled forensic share (\\investigations\...). No credentials or execution artifacts were found, and no user interaction occurred. Redaction was applied to user PII (email) before sharing. A sanitized version of the attachment was prepared for safe educational use.

Reflection

In retrospect, I would revisit the timing of the domain analysis—relying initially on passive tools like VirusTotal delayed identifying the phishing infrastructure. A deeper, earlier DNS lookup might have helped. Also, I’d prepare a reusable playbook for phishing triage to improve response consistency and reduce decision fatigue.
