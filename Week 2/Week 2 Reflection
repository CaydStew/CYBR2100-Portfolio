What I Learned
This week deepened my understanding of key privacy principles, including notice and consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, and proportionality. The principle of notice and consent ensures individuals are informed about data collection and can actively agree to it. Purpose limitation means data should only be collected for clearly defined, legitimate reasons and not reused for unrelated purposes. Data minimization stresses collecting only the data that is strictly necessary, helping reduce the risk of overreach or abuse. Proportionality helps evaluate whether the benefits of monitoring or data collection outweigh the potential harms. In Ethics in Technology by Ed Weber (2025), these principles are discussed as foundational to ethical tech design, especially in surveillance and workplace monitoring contexts. The book echoes policies like the OECD Privacy Guidelines, which emphasize fairness and transparency in data handling. Together, these frameworks push for systems that respect autonomy while still enabling necessary oversight.
How I’ll Apply It
To apply proportional privacy practices, I would redesign a workplace monitoring system used in a customer service call center. Currently, full-screen monitoring and keystroke logging run throughout an employee’s shift. I would limit the scope of monitoring to active customer interaction windows only, excluding time spent on breaks or administrative tasks. Notice and consent would be built into the onboarding process with clear documentation, and employees would receive reminders before each monitored session. For data retention, recordings and logs would be stored for 30 days, just long enough to resolve disputes or conduct performance reviews, then securely deleted. Only supervisors with a defined need would access the data. This approach balances operational oversight with employee privacy and aligns with ethical standards discussed in this week's materials.
Muddiest Point
One question I still have is about the line between explicit and implied consent. In institutional settings, is clicking “I agree” on a general policy document considered sufficient explicit consent for ongoing surveillance? Or does each new monitoring tool or data practice require separate, informed consent? I'm also curious how this plays out legally—whether implied consent can hold up in privacy violation disputes if users weren’t fully aware of what they were agreeing to.
Portfolio Note
I will add a new section called "Ethical Monitoring Redesign" featuring my updated workplace monitoring model.

It will showcase how to apply privacy principles like proportionality and data minimization in real-world systems.

This is important because it reflects my ability to think critically about ethics in technology and design practical, respectful systems.
