Principles Summary
Notice and Consent means informing users about what data is collected and getting their agreement before monitoring begins.
Purpose Limitation ensures that data is collected for specific, clear purposes and not reused in unrelated ways.
Data Minimization requires collecting only the information needed to fulfill a stated purpose.
Proportionality ensures that any monitoring or data collection is balanced and not overly invasive for the goal it seeks to achieve.


My Monitoring & Retention Clause
Monitoring & Notice
Hocking College monitors institutional systems—including email, learning platforms, and network activity—to ensure operational security, support academic integrity, and comply with institutional policies. Monitoring is limited to professional use contexts and conducted only by authorized personnel. This includes metadata such as login times, access logs, and usage patterns, but excludes private content unless required by law or as part of an official investigation. Users are notified of monitoring at login screens, through the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and during onboarding. Continued system use implies consent to these terms.


Data Handling & Retention
The institution collects only the data necessary to fulfill its security, academic, and compliance obligations. Access to monitoring data is restricted to trained staff on a need-to-know basis, and all access is logged. Retention is limited to 30 days unless data is needed for an active investigation or subject to legal hold. After this period, data is securely deleted. Individuals may request clarification, raise concerns, or appeal actions related to monitoring through the IT Services or HR/Student Affairs Office. Misuse of systems or violation of policy may lead to access restrictions and disciplinary procedures, in accordance with institutional codes of conduct.


Justification
This policy applies the principles of notice and consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, and proportionality. It aligns with practices outlined in institutional privacy policies and legal guidelines such as the EDUCAUSE Model Privacy Notice and other higher-ed monitoring frameworks. The design ensures users are informed, only essential data is collected, and data use is appropriate to the academic setting.

Reflection
If I were to tighten the policy, I would consider shortening the data retention period to 14 days to reduce potential risk exposure. I’d also clarify the appeals process by providing a clear, accessible form for concerns or objections. This would improve transparency and empower users. These adjustments would increase trust among users while still meeting the institution’s operational needs.
