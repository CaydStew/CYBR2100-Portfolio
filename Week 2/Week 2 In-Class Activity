Monitoring & Notice
Hocking College monitors institutional systems—including email, learning platforms, and network activity—to ensure operational security, support academic integrity, and comply with institutional policies. Monitoring is limited to 
professional use contexts and conducted only by authorized personnel. This includes metadata such as login times, access logs, and usage patterns, but excludes private content unless required by law or as part of an official investigation. Users are notified of monitoring at login screens, through the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and during onboarding. Continued system use implies consent to these terms.

Data Handling & Retention
The institution collects only the data necessary to fulfill its security, academic, and compliance obligations. Access to monitoring data is restricted to trained 
staff with a need-to-know basis, and all access is logged. Retention is limited to 30 days unless data is needed for an active investigation or subject to legal hold. 
After this period, data is securely deleted. Individuals may request clarification, raise concerns, or appeal actions related to monitoring through the IT Services or HR/Student Affairs Office. Misuse of systems or violation of policy may lead to access restrictions and disciplinary procedures, in accordance with institutional 
codes of conduct
